# gan_notmnist

It is Generative Adversarial Networks based approach to generate large quantity of Data to facilitate good training results using other Deep Learning Models.

For this repository we have considered the NOT_MNIST dataset and trained a GAN for 100epochs which generates 250 Thousand training images which is fed to the deep convolutional neural net to classify.

We observed significant increse in accuracy of the model.
